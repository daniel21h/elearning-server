Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)


The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer
